In variables_and_math.html,

1. Change the values of a and b to determine the following values:

	14274 + 2303 = 16577
	14274 - 2303 = 11971
	14274 * 2303 = 32873022
	14274 / 2303 = 6.198002605297438

2. What is the value of 2^18? (The ^ operator does not mean exponents in JavaScript.
   Use the Math.pow function instead.) 262144

3. Change the name and age variables to represent yourself. Add a third variable city
   which stores the city where you were born. Then write a sentence such as "Jon is 44
   years old. He was born in Chicago."


In events.html,

4. Add a second prompt to the greet function so that it also asks for your age. Then
   have the function write a sentence like "Hello, Jon. I see you are 42 years old."
   to the message paragraph.

5. Add a button that is connected to a triangleArea function. Then write a triangleArea
   function in functions.js that prompts the user for both the base and height of the
   triangle and then calculates the area. Write the result in a complete sentence to
   the answer div.

6. Add a button that is connected to a circumference function. Then write a circumference
   function in functions.js that prompts the user for both the radius of a circle and
   then calculates the circumference. Write the result in a complete sentence to the
   answer div. Use the Math.pi constant to get an accurate value for pi.

7. Explain the difference between string and numeric values.
String values can contain letters, numbers, and other characters. Numeric variables can only contain numbers.
You have to put string values in quotes, but you do not have to do the same for numeric variables.
